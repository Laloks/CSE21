1.What are the return types of the sumAll methods?
long

2.What relation must be true between lengths of arr and max for the second version of sumAll to work correctly?
The array must be atleast the length of max

3. What are the return types of the sqareSum methods?
long

4.What is the use of init(arr) call before calling squareSum(arr,5)?
it sets all the values in the array to zero after changing them from sumall

5.What are the return types of the fib methods?
long

6.Why does Fibonacci output start at 2?
because at 1 it could go outside the bounds of the array

7.What are the return types of the factorial methods?
long

8.Why does Factorial output start at 2?
because it could go outside the bounds of the array

9.Why is long[] arr = new long[MAXSIZE]; declared as an array of longs?
because they may need 64 bits

10.Change MAXSIZE to 10. Does everything still work? If not,how can you fix it?
It doesnt work but it can be fixed by not trying to use bigger numbers than the array or adding values to the array
