Assessment

1) For the recur method in the SimpleRecursion class, answer the following:

	a. What is the output of version 1 called with argument 0 .
Entering recur with k = 0
Recursing with k = 0
Entering recur with k = 1
Recursing with k = 1
Entering recur with k = 2
Recursing with k = 2
Entering recur with k = 3
Recursing with k = 3
Entering recur with k = 4
Leaving recur with k = 4
Leaving recur with k = 3
Leaving recur with k = 2
Leaving recur with k = 1
Leaving recur with k = 0
	b. What is the output of version 2 called with argument 0 .
count = 0
count = 1
count = 2
count = 3
count = 4
count = 5
	c. What is the output of version 3 called with argument 0 .

	d. What is the output of version 4 called with argument 0 .
count = 0
count = 1
count = 2
count = 3
count = 4
	
	e. What is the output of version 5 called with argument 0 .
count = 0
	
	f. What is the output of version 6 called with argument 0 . How can we run all 6 versions at once? (hint: name overloading does not work)
count = 0
count = 1
count = 2
count = 3
count = 4
	call the recur below the current one down to version 1
2) After filling-in the reverse6 method in the NaiveReverse class, can you think of how to extend this algorithm for reverse7 method? Explain.
	yes do the same thing for an increased substring or use recursion by calling reverse6
	
3) Answer the following questions concerning the reverse9 method given in Task 2:
	a. A student tests the reverse9 method on the String "confident" . What will it return?
	ctnedifno
	b. What should be the proper reversed string for "confident" ?
	tnedifnoc
	c. Suggest how to fix the code so the method does it correctly.
	put the first letter at the end
	
4) Answer the following questions concerning the digitCount method in the DigitCount class:
	a. What is returned from the call digitCount(0) ?
	1
	b. What is returned from the call digitCount(10) ?
	2
	c. What is returned from the call digitCount(314159) ?
	6
	d. Should the digit count increase if the value is 0 ? If not how should the code change
	no
	e. What are other values of value for which digit count should not increase? Change the code to include those values.
	up to 10
	
12.2.2, 12.3.3, 12.4.1, 12.5.2 and 12.6.2
6 1 no
3 7
true true false
false true true
3 when both are equal
