1)How can you tell a method is a constructor?
no return type, same name as the class

2) Would public void cheese() be considered a constructor?
no because the return type is void

3) Does it make sense to have private or void accessor method?
no because it would get nothing

4) Would public void setName() be a good mutator declaration?
yeah if it had a parameter

5) How can you tell the difference between instance and class variables?
class variables apply to all objects of the class while instance variables apply to each object separately

6) Can we write name = name; and what would it mean?
it would set the instances name to itself and would be pointless

7) How can you tell which version of the constructor is being called?
By the number of variables used and type of variable

8) What does the . operator do for objects?
the . operator calls the method of after the . to perform its operation in the object

9) Can you use a loop to implement calcSubTotal ?
no because we dont have an array for the objects

10) Can you tell when and where we do the recursion in run() ?
at the end when it asks to redo the order

11) What does this refer to?
refers to the object

12) What should be the value of numCheese when RunShop terminates (i.e., the output of the println
statement)?
3
13) Give the code to implement public void setName(String name) { ... } .
public void setName(String name) { 
		this.name = name;
