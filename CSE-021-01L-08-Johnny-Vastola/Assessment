1) What are the minimal changes required to instantiate ShopArr and invoke run() on it?
change Shop to ShopArr

2) We can also use a <something>.length instead of max . What is the valid <something> to use in ShopArr.java ?
cheese

3) How can we tell which instantiation ( new Cheese ) corresponds to which constructor definition inside the Cheese class?
By the parameters

4) How can we identify a mutator method call?
object.setX();

5) What would be the result if we added this line right after Swiss is created: cheese[2].setName("Wrong Name"); ?
it would change the name from "Swiss" to "Wrong name"

6) Why is the init() method both private and void?
because it is only used in the class and has no return

7) What are the distinguishing features of constructor methods? (i.e., How do we tell them apart from other methods?)
same name as class no return type

8) How can we figure out the number of required iterations for each loop?
difference between original i and final

9) Should we pass in Cheese array pointer ( cheese[] ) as arguments into calcSubTotal or itemizedList ? (Why or why not)
no because its an instance variable and doesn't need to be taken as a parameter

10) What value will be printed by RunShop for “ Ran with Cheese Total ”? (fixed number or a formula)
the input for the number of cheeses
