		amounts[3] = 1; valid
	
	e. Give the output of the following statements:
		System.out.println("Cheese "+ 'A' + 10); Cheese A10
		System.out.println("Cheese "+ (char)'A' + 10); Cheese A10
		System.out.println("Cheese "+ (int)'A' + 10); Cheese 6510
		System.out.println("Cheese "+ (char)('A' + 10)); Cheese K
		System.out.println("Cheese "+ (int)('A' + 10)); Cheese 75
