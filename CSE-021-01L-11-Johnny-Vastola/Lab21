Task 4 Think about which of these players will play a better game of Pig. Simulate several games (by executing main of 
PigSimulator.java) pitting them against each other, and report what happened. Was your prediction correct? 
RiskyPlayer Should be worse and it is failing nearly every game

Task 6 Test all four players against each other, which will take several simulations. Explain what happened. How did your
 strategies do? Did you expect to see the results you saw?
